## Description:

- This is an HSL (hue, saturation, light) color picker for CSS. It generates a random color upon the click of a button and custom colors when the user drags the sliders. It also displays and updates a CSS color code so that users may copy it for use in their own projects.

- This exercise responds to user events and uses state in React to drive changes to the user interface.

### Built with:

- JavaScript - https://www.javascript.com/

- React.js - https://reactjs.org/

- CSS
